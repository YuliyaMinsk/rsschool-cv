## Summary

I was working as Lotes Notes developer in 12 years. My last projects have been related to staff assessment and development. It was very exciting and I wanted to know more! When my project was closed, as it was being transferred to newer technologies, I decided to continue my education in human development. I have been working with individual entrepreneurs on the development of their Internet projects for 7 years. 

Now I would like to deepen my knowledge in development to better understand the new opportunities that the Internet and mobile technologies provide. I really like writing code! And I want to perfect at Javascript and React.
